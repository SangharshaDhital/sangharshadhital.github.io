                  <p>Born amidst the serene peaks of the Himalayas, I am a seeker at heart—a technologist, philosopher, and artist woven into one. My story is a tapestry of curiosity, bridging the whispers of ancient rivers and the hum of modern innovation, driven by a relentless passion to unravel the magic of ideas and shape them into reality.</p>
                  <p>Growing up in a Himalayan town where the sky met the mountains, simplicity was my first teacher. The rhythms of nature—the murmuring rivers, the stoic peaks—instilled in me a deep reverence for the interconnectedness of life. Yet, tales of distant technologies sparked my imagination, planting seeds of wonder about the invisible threads that bind our world.</p>  
                    <p>At 15, I encountered my first computer—a portal to a universe I had only dreamed of. The glow of the screen, the tactile click of keys—it was a revelation. What began as fascination soon became obsession. I devoured books, taught myself to code, and discovered the language of logic and creation. Technology transformed from a mystery into a craft: a bridge between thought and tangible impact, where each line of code became a step toward building the unimaginable.</p>
                   <p>To me, technology is more than circuits and algorithms—it’s the poetry of problem-solving. It merges the precision of logic with the fluidity of creativity, turning abstract dreams into tools that uplift and connect. My work is guided by the belief that innovation thrives at the intersection of disciplines, where philosophy, art, and science converge to illuminate new paths.</p>
                   <p>Beyond technology, I am drawn to the mysteries of existence. The timeless questions of philosophy, the spiritual insights of Vedic texts, the patterns of nature, and the emotional resonance of music all fuel my curiosity. These threads enrich my perspective, reminding me that true innovation lies in synthesizing diverse wisdom—whether decoding an algorithm or contemplating the cosmos.</p>
                  <p>My journey is one of perpetual discovery. From Himalayan valleys to the frontiers of technology, I embrace challenges as invitations to grow. Every problem solved, every idea explored, adds a stitch to the tapestry of progress. The future is a canvas of endless possibilities, and I walk forward with a learner’s humility and a creator’s boldness—eager to shape a world where technology and humanity flourish in harmony.</p>
                  <p>Curiosity is my compass. Creation is my language. And in the dance between the two, I find my purpose: to learn, to build, and to weave a legacy that echoes the wisdom of the mountains and the boundless potential of the human spirit.</p>

                    <p>Hi! I’m a self-taught developer driven by a deep love for turning ideas into functional, meaningful tools. My journey began in the Himalayas, where the simplicity of nature taught me to see patterns and connections—skills I now bring to coding. While I’m just starting out, my curiosity and dedication fuel my growth every day.</p>  

                    <p>I bring foundational skills in building user-friendly interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, focusing on clean, intuitive design. On the back-end, I’m exploring Java and Spring Boot to create structured applications, learning concepts like MVC and RESTful APIs. I enjoy problem-solving, whether debugging code or optimizing a feature, and I’m committed to writing maintainable, organized solutions.</p>  
                    
                    <p>Technology, to me, is about solving real problems with empathy and creativity. I’m inspired by how code can connect people, simplify tasks, and bring ideas to life. Beyond syntax, I care about collaborating with others to build solutions that matter, and I actively study modern tools like microservices and cloud basics (AWS), alongside timeless principles like clean code and design patterns.</p>  
                    
                    <p>I’m eager to join a team where I can grow as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and learn from experienced mentors. While I’m early in my career, I bring enthusiasm, adaptability, and a commitment to continuous improvement. Let’s build something great—one line of code at a time!</p>

                        <p>Coding, for me, is more than just writing lines of code—it's like solving a puzzle, creating something out of nothing, and bringing ideas to life. Every function, every loop, every bug fixed is a small victory, a step closer to building something meaningful.</p>

                        <p>Just like an artist uses a brush, I use my keyboard to craft logic and design. Whether it’s a simple script or a full-fledged application, coding gives me the power to create, innovate, and turn thoughts into reality.</p>
                        
                        <p>What started as curiosity has become a passion—a hobby that challenges me, excites me, and keeps me learning every day. The thrill of seeing my code come to life, whether in a web page, an app, or a simple automation, is what makes it truly rewarding.</p>
                        
                        <p>For me, coding isn’t just about computers—it’s about creativity, problem-solving, and the joy of building something from scratch. And with every new project, I’m reminded that the possibilities are endless.</p>

                        <p>With just my phone in hand, I capture the world as it unfolds—one frame at a time. Photography, to me, is like painting with light, a way to preserve the masterpiece of the Almighty Creator and the brilliance of human imagination.</p>

                        <p>From golden sunsets to bustling streets, from quiet smiles to spontaneous moments, my mobile camera lets me freeze time, turning everyday scenes into lasting memories. The best shots aren’t always planned; they happen in an instant—a reflection in a puddle, a shadow stretching across the pavement, or a fleeting glance between strangers.</p>
                        
                        <p>More than just a hobby, mobile photography is my way of seeing and sharing the world. No heavy gear, no complex setups—just a pocket-sized window to capture life’s beauty, anytime, anywhere.</p>

                        <p>Since childhood, I have been drawn to colors—just like any child would be. But for me, colors were more than just play; they were a language, a way to express what words could not.</p>

<p>I remember filling the pages of my black-and-white books with bursts of color, turning empty spaces into vivid landscapes of my imagination. As I grew, my love for colors evolved into abstract painting—where emotions flow freely, unshaped by rules, guided only by feeling.</p>

<p>Each stroke, each splash, is a story—a moment captured in shades and textures. Painting, for me, is not just art; it is a reflection of my thoughts, my dreams, and the endless possibilities of creation.</p>

                        <div class="text">Music</div>
                        <p>Music, to me, is more than just sound—it’s a feeling, a language that speaks beyond words. Whether I’m singing or playing an instrument, I find joy in creating melodies that express what cannot be said.</p>

                        <p>Every sound is a melody if we know the perfect note. The strum of a guitar, the rhythm of a drum, or the simple hum of a tune—all come together in harmony, turning ordinary moments into something magical.</p>
                        
                        <p>When I sing, I lose myself in the music, letting emotions flow freely. When I play, I feel the rhythm connect with my heartbeat, a reminder that music is everywhere—in the wind, in the rain, in the laughter of people around me.</p>
                        
                        <p>Music is not just a hobby; it’s a part of who I am. It lifts me up, calms my mind, and reminds me that life itself is a beautiful symphony waiting to be played.</p>

                        <p>Writing poetry in my mother tongue, Nepali, is more than just a hobby—it is a way to express my deepest thoughts, emotions, and dreams. Each word I weave carries the essence of my culture, my roots, and the beauty of the language I grew up with.</p>

                        <p>Through poetry, I paint pictures with words, capturing the rhythm of life, the whispers of nature, and the unspoken feelings of the heart. Whether it's a verse about the towering Himalayas, the simplicity of village life, or the complexities of human emotions, my poems are a reflection of my soul.</p>
                        
                        <p>There is something special about writing in Nepali—it feels pure, unfiltered, and deeply personal. The melodies of the words, the flow of the script, and the emotions they carry make each poem a piece of my journey.</p>
                        
                        <p>For me, poetry is not just about rhymes and rhythms; it is about storytelling, about preserving my language and heritage, and about finding beauty in the smallest of moments.</p>

                        <p>Listening to philosophers is more than just a pastime for me—it is a journey into deep thinking and self-exploration. Their words challenge my perspectives, offering insights into life, existence, and the human mind.</p>

                        <p>Each discourse feels like unlocking a new dimension of thought, whether it’s about awareness, happiness, or the mysteries of the universe. The way they question everything inspires me to think beyond the obvious, to seek wisdom rather than just answers.</p>
                        
                        <p>For me, listening to philosophers is not just about learning; it’s about expanding my mind, embracing new ideas, and finding meaning in the simplest of things.</p>
